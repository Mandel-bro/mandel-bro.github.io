            <h1>Mandelbro, creating products in chaos.</h1>
            <p>
                It is not enough to say that every detail count. How to consider
                each detail? Is each detail itself enough? Under each detail live
                worlds - entire branches of reality. We may want to pursue each of
                these worlds and handle every of their problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where does it stop? A fractal model tell us it can repeat
                indefinitely, repeating itself with the same
                information, over and over with the same signal.
                A Mandelbrot set suggests it never stops: each frontier of the set
                adds new information at every level you consider. The signal may
                seems familiar, it may contains know patterns. However each add
                new information - add signal value. It cannot be easily
                predicted without. No step is really known without the previous.
                You must follow the process: walk each step to get to the next.
            </p>
            <p>
                We base our work on the assumption that creating products and
                software is a walk in a Mandelbro set. To create a new product
                and a new world is to take each step to get to this world. Each
                step provides data you need to go to the next one. Without following
                the process, there is no chance but to get lost in your walk in
                chaos.
            </p>
            <p>
                Creating a product with us is engaging in a learning process.
                This walk in the chaos of software development, user experience
                and investors expectations is to get the maximum information
                with the least energy and time. Better to go steadily on the path
                than jumping too fast in the dark.
            </p>
            <p>
                Following the Mandelbro process,<br>
                each iteration of a product,<br>
                either a Proof of Concept or a production-scale version,<br>
                can expand itself as a fractal border,<br>
                to create a new reality,<br>
                and new worlds to pursue.
